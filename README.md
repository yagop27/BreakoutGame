# Breakout game

This game was built with Python, using mainly the Turtle library. This code was organized in different files, looking to 
make a more organized project, so the project is separated in 5 files:

- main.py: Where the whole project is connected to make the game work. This is the file to be executed to run the game.
- paddle.py: This file configures the paddle that the player controls to play the game.
- bricks.py: Is a simple file that sets up a code to create the multiple bricks to be destroyed later.
- score.py: Sets up the scoreboard that is shown in the top right corner, updating the scoreboard as the game progresses, 
  and it also is responsible for setting up the next levels after the player finishes one.
